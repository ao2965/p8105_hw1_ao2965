The variables are as follows: origin: Weather station. Named origin to
facilitate merging with nycflights13::flights data. year, month, day,
hour: Time of recording. temp, dewp: Temperature and dewpoint in F.
humid: Relative humidity. wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust: Wind
direction (in degrees), speed and gust speed (in mph). precip:
Precipitation, in inches. pressure: Sea level pressure in millibars.
visib: Visibility in miles. time_hour: Date and hour of the recording as
a POSIXct date. The mean temperature is 39.5821229 °F. This dataset has
358 rows and 15 columns.

The pattern of the scatterplot shows that as time goes by, temperature
is seen to be increasing. The plot also shows that humididty is recorded
to be increasing with time. there is a period of time around Jan 14 when
humidity is recorded to be higher than usual.
