``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

The variables are as follows:

- origin: Weather station. Named origin to facilitate merging with
  nycflights13::flights data.

- year, month, day, hour: Time of recording.

- temp, dewp: Temperature and dewpoint in F.

- humid: Relative humidity.

- wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust: Wind direction (in degrees), speed
  and gust speed (in mph).

- precip: Precipitation, in inches.

- pressure: Sea level pressure in millibars.

- visib: Visibility in miles.

- time_hour: Date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date.

- The mean temperature is 39.5821229 °F.

- This dataset has 358 rows.

- This dataset has 15 columns.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp,color = humid)) + geom_point() + labs(
    title = "Temperature over Time (colored by Humidity)",
    x = "time_hour", y = "temp", color = "Humidity"
  )
```

The pattern of the scatterplot shows that as time goes by, temperature
is seen to be increasing. The plot also shows that humidity is recorded
to be increasing with time. There is a period of time around Jan 14 when
humidity is recorded to be higher than usual.

set.seed(1234)
q2_df = tibble(
  q2_num = rnorm(10),                                    
  q2_log = q2_num > 0,                                   
  q2_chr = c("apple","banana","cherry","grape","blueberry","blackberry", "strawberry", "rasberry", "mango", "kiwi"), 
  q2_vec = factor(rep(c("high", "medium", "low"), length.out = 10))

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, q2_num))
```

    ## [1] -0.3831574

The mean for the random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal
distribution was -0.3831574

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, q2_log))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

The mean for logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample
are greater than 0 was 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, q2_chr))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(q2_df, q2_chr)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(q2_df, q2_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(q2_df, q2_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We could not find the mean for a character vector of length 10 and a
factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”. This is
because means only work for numerical values.

``` r
as.numeric(q2_df %>% pull(q2_log))  
as.numeric(q2_df %>% pull(q2_chr))  
as.numeric(q2_df %>% pull(q2_vec))
```

Logical variables, which contain TRUE and FALSE values, are internally
stored as 1 and 0. So, converting logicals to numeric results in 1s and
0s, making it possible to calculate the mean as the proportion of TRUE
values. Character variables consist of strings that do not represent
numbers. Applying as.numeric() to these produces NA values with a
warning because characters like fruit names cannot be meaningfully
converted to numbers. Factor variables are categorical but internally
stored as integer codes representing the factor levels. When converted
to numeric, the codes will give mean, but it will give mean for the
integer level codes. So, it would be meaningless.

This explains why the mean function in R works directly on numeric and
logical types but produces errors when applied to character or factor
variables. It is also important to be careful of averaging mixed
columns, or we will end up with misleading numbers.
